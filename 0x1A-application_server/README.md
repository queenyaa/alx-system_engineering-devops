Task 2 involves configuring Nginx to serve a Flask web application from the route /airbnb-onepage/ both locally and on its public IP on port 80. Additionally, Nginx should proxy requests to the Flask application process listening on port 5000. Here are the requirements:

1. **Nginx Configuration:**
   - Nginx should be configured to serve the Flask application from the route /airbnb-onepage/.
   - Requests to the public IP on port 80 should be proxied to the Flask application running on port 5000.

2. **Configuration File:**
   - The Nginx configuration file should be named 2-app_server-nginx_config.

3. **Testing:**
   - To test the configuration, the Flask application server (listening on port 5000) needs to be running.
   - Once Nginx is configured, it should be accessible both locally and publicly via the public IP on port 80.
   - It may be necessary to reboot the server using the command sudo reboot to ensure that Nginx is publicly accessible.

4. **Production Considerations:**
   - In a production environment, the Flask application server would be configured to start automatically upon system startup using a system initialization script.
   - This task focuses on configuring Nginx, but in a real-world scenario, additional steps would be required to ensure proper server management and availability.

In summary, Task 2 aims to set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to serve the Flask application, providing both local and public access on port 80 while proxying requests to the Flask application running on port 5000. This configuration is essential for deploying web applications in production environments and ensuring accessibility and scalability.

## Task 3

Task 3 expands the web application by adding another service to handle requests related to determining whether a given integer is odd or even. Here's the importance of this task:

1. **Service Expansion**: By adding another service to the web application, it enhances its functionality and usefulness. This demonstrates the ability to scale and extend the application to accommodate additional features and user needs.

2. **Nginx Configuration**: Configuring Nginx to proxy requests to two different Gunicorn instances running on different ports showcases the ability to manage multiple services efficiently. This setup allows for better organization and separation of concerns within the application architecture.

3. **Dynamic Routing**: The task involves configuring Nginx to handle dynamic routes, where requests to the `/airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer)` route are forwarded to the appropriate Gunicorn instance based on the requested integer's odd or even status. This demonstrates advanced routing and proxying capabilities.

4. **Public Access**: Like in Task 2, Nginx is configured to serve the application both locally and on its public IP on port 80, ensuring accessibility to users over the internet. This enables users to interact with the application seamlessly regardless of their location.

5. **Tips for Process Management**: The task provides tips on managing multiple Gunicorn instances using terminal multiplexing utilities like tmux. This ensures efficient management of background processes, allowing for easier monitoring and termination when necessary.

Overall, Task 3 showcases advanced configurations and techniques for scaling and managing web applications, ensuring optimal performance, flexibility, and user experience.

## Task 4

Task 4 of the project involves setting up Nginx to serve the RESTful API built for the AirBnB clone version 3 on a specific server (web-01). This task is essential for ensuring that the API endpoints are accessible to users over the internet and that the server can handle incoming requests efficiently.

The importance of Task 4 can be summarized as follows:

1. **Service Availability**: By configuring Nginx to route requests to a Gunicorn instance serving the API, Task 4 ensures that the API endpoints are accessible both locally and over the public IP of the server. This enhances the availability of the service to users.

2. **Load Distribution**: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, distributing incoming requests to the Gunicorn instance running the API. This helps in distributing the load efficiently across multiple workers, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the service.

3. **Security**: Properly configuring Nginx adds an additional layer of security by shielding the backend Gunicorn server from direct exposure to the internet. Nginx can handle tasks such as SSL termination, rate limiting, and access control, thereby enhancing the security posture of the application.

4. **Scalability**: The setup described in Task 4 lays the foundation for horizontal scaling of the application. Additional backend servers running Gunicorn instances can be added behind Nginx to handle increased traffic as the application grows, ensuring scalability.

5. **Testing and Documentation**: Documenting and testing the Nginx configuration file (uploaded as 4-app_server-nginx_config) is crucial for ensuring that the setup works as intended and can be replicated across different environments. This documentation serves as a reference for future maintenance and troubleshooting efforts.

Overall, Task 4 plays a vital role in deploying and maintaining a reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure for hosting the AirBnB clone v3 RESTful API, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

## Task 5
