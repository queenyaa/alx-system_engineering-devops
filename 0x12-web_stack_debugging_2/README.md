## Task 0
---
Task 0 focuses on the importance of avoiding direct usage of the root user in Linux systems for security reasons. The task encourages the use of privileged users with specific commands instead of relying solely on the root user. The script created for this task allows users to execute the `whoami` command under a specified user, showcasing the ability to perform tasks as other users with elevated privileges. This practice enhances system security by minimizing the risk associated with running commands as the root user, reducing the likelihood of unintended and irreversible actions. The script promotes a safer and more controlled approach to user privileges in Linux environments.
